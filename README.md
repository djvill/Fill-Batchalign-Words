# `Fill-Batchalign-Words`

Dan Villarreal

This repository hosts a Shiny app (https://djvill.shinyapps.io/fill-batchalign-words/) that allows users to fill transcribed words from [Batchalign](https://github.com/TalkBank/batchalign) into files with speaker diarization via [pyannote](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio), customizing the output via several parameters.
