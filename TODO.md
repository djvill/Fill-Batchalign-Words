# TODO

- Add 'loading spinners' with [`shinycssloaders`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinycssloaders/index.html)
- Separate the generation of `wordDF` and cache the result (so the user can generate versions w/ different settings w/o waiting for time-consuming splitWords() call every time)
